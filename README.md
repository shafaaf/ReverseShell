# Reverse Shell

Way to connect to someone's computer from anywhere in the world

Why using this:
- Ip addresses are not public and dynamic and always changing
- Even if same network, and know ipaddress there are firewall, port forwarding issues etc
So cant ssh into someone's home computer like a web server all the time.

Can set up own server and make target connect to us.

In short, shell for any computer.

Hackers can use and make others click on it through cd, usb etc.
