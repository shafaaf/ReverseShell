Way to connect to someone's computer from anywhere in the world

Why:
- Ip addresses are not public and dynamic and always changing
- Even if same network, and know ipaddress theres firewall, port forwarding issues etc

So cant ssh into someone's home computer like a web server

Can set up home server and make target connect to us.

In short, shell for any computer.

Hackers can use and make others click on it through cd, usb etc.
